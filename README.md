# 👩‍💻 Blanca Pinot 

- 👋 Hi, I’m @blancadevux  
- 👀 I’m passionate about **designing and building digital products** that are both functional and user-friendly.  
- 🌱 I have experience in **UX/UI design**, **JavaScript**, **Java**, **Vue**, and **React** — and I’m currently exploring both frontend and backend to discover where I feel most at home.  
- 💞️ I’m open to collaborating on projects where I can learn, contribute, and grow — especially in creative, inclusive tech environments.  
- 📫 How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/blancapinot) | blankitta@gmail.com | bpinotj@outlook.com  
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love sketching ideas, mapping out user journeys, and turning concepts into real, working experiences — one iteration at a time.

✨ I'm still exploring my path in tech, but every step — from UX flows to backend logic — is part of the journey.
